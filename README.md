### Hi I'm Matt

I'm in my final year of my Software Engineering degree at McMaster University

- I’m currently working on my engineering capstone project: [Book Bazar](https://github.com/calebmech/Book-Bazar)
- I’m also working on a multiplayer game for fun: [Math Racer](https://github.com/Matthew-dw/MathRacer)
